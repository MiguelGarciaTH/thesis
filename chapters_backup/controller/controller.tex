\chapter{Untrusted (distributed) controller}
\label{chap:controler}

As in previous works~\cite{Roeder:2010,Platania:2014}, our current design for \sieveq and \system considers a centralized trusted control plane that analyze \gls{osint} and orchestrate replica group reconfigurations.
It would be desirable to have a distributed version of such control plane, not only for improving its dependability, but also to support the existence of multi-domain applications, such as blockchain platforms.
